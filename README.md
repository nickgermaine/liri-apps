#### Notes

First, this project was forked from Slingscold launcher, which you can check out [link](https://github.com/libredeb/slingscold "here").

To install, simply clone this repository, and from the projects root directory, run:

	sh ./compile.sh 

Forked from Slingscold, few improvements have been made so far, but the plan is to make it material design.
