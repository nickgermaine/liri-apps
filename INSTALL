To install Slingshot from the source, you need to compile it.

== Compilation ==

- First, we need a build directory:
    mkdir build
    cd build
- Then, configure CMake:
    cmake ..
    Here, you can get some errors if you don't have all the dependencies.
- Compile it:
    make
    You can also use make -j3 if you have a dual core. (it will be much faster)

== Launch Slingshot ==

- Just run slingshot:
    ./slingshot

== Install Slingshot ==

- With the administrator rights, use:
    make install
    Or:
    sudo make install

- You can now launch Slingshot using:
    slingshot
    Or:
    /usr/local/bin/slingshot
